Housing Estate Management System in Java

Description:
This Java project implements a system for managing a housing estate, including functionalities for managing apartments, parking spaces, vehicles, and tenants. It provides an interactive menu for users to perform various operations and simulates the passage of time to track rent durations and payments.

Exception Handling: Implemented custom exceptions to handle specific scenarios like too many tenants or items in a space.
Interactive Menu: Created a menu-driven interface for user interaction with the system.
Scheduled Tasks: Used scheduled executor services to simulate the passage of time and check for overdue payments.
